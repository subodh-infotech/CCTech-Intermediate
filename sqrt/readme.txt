
Introduction
---------------
this program takes a number as input by user and calculate square root of that number internally and display the result on console. This function user sqrt() function of <cmath> header file of cpp. If we provide any negative number then this program throw error and display message on console.

How to start
-------------------
In this program only one file (sqrt.cpp) is available. In that file there is a UDF and main() function. To run this program just compile that file and execute it. 
when we execute this program we get an message on console for input like - 
"Enter any number : "
after input we get result on console in following format.
for example - 
Enter any number : 
144
12 --> It is output generated by program

Test case
--------------
1. when we input any negative number then this program generate error message.
2. when we input any value that is not number then this program display result as '0'.

except these things we input any number then we will get expected ouput.
